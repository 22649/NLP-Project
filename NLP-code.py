print("""
**PART 1: Country Name Clustering**
We used character-level TF-IDF (analyzing groups of 2-4 characters) to vectorize country names. K-Means clustering then grouped countries based on the linguistic patterns in their names.
- **Observation:** Clusters often contain countries with similar suffixes (e.g., '-land', '-ia') or common roots. This is a novel way to categorize countries based purely on the phonetics and spelling of their names, which can sometimes correlate with linguistic or historical ties.

**PART 2: Synthetic Energy Topic Modeling**
Since the dataset lacked genuine unstructured text, we generated a small corpus of energy-related sentences. Standard NLP techniques (preprocessing, TF-IDF, NMF) were applied to this corpus.
- **Result:** The Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) model successfully identified coherent topics from the synthetic text, such as:
  1. **Renewable Expansion** (solar, wind, renewable)
  2. **Traditional Energy Dynamics** (coal, gas, nuclear)
  3. **Supporting Technologies** (energy, storage, technology)

**Conclusion:** This exercise demonstrates the full NLP workflow. The methods used on the synthetic data are directly applicable to real-world text data, such as energy policy documents, news articles, or social media posts about energy.
